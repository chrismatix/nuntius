# Nuntius

A macOS menu bar app for speech-to-text transcription.

## Features

- 🔒 **Fully local transcription** — uses [WhisperKit](https://github.com/argmaxinc/WhisperKit), no data leaves your Mac
- ☁️ **Cloud option** — connect OpenAI's API if you prefer
- ⌨️ **Global hotkey** — start dictating from anywhere
- 📝 **Text snippets** — define shortcuts that expand into longer text
- 💾 **Save to file** — store transcriptions locally for later
- 🪶 **Lightweight** — lives quietly in your menu bar
